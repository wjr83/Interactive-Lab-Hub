## Project Plan
Using the tools and techniques learned in this class, design, prototype, and test an interactive device that can distinguish between recyclable objects (paper, cardboard, plastic, glass, metal), trash, and batteries. 

#### COLLABORATOR: [Khushi Bhansali (ID: kb737)](https://github.com/Khushibhansali/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Fall2023/FinalProject.md)

### Big Idea & Motivation for Project & Objective
- A system to recognize recyclable objects from non-recyclable objects is motivated by several factors:

> - Environmental Conservation: Effective waste separation and recycling play a crucial role in reducing the environmental impact of waste disposal. It helps conserve resources, reduce energy consumption, and lower greenhouse gas emissions.
> - Waste Reduction: Proper recycling minimizes the volume of waste sent to landfills or incinerators, leading to a reduction in the need for landfill space and decreased pollution from incineration.
> - Consumer Education: Confusion among individuals about the correct sorting of waste is a common issue. This system can serve as an educational tool, clarifying recycling guidelines and encouraging responsible disposal practices.
> - Convenience: Many consumers find it challenging to decipher complex instructions or symbols on bins. A machine learning solution simplifies the process by instantly classifying waste items through images, making it more user-friendly.

#### Intended Operation
- The system identifies an object and classifies it as one of the 5 recycled materials (paper, cardboard, glass, plastic, and metal), compost, special handling materials (e.g., batteries), or otherwise as trash.

> - Primary Goal: Design a system capable of identifying recyclable objects (paper, cardboard, plastic, glass, and metal), compost, items requiring special handling (e.g., batteries), and trash.
> - Secondary Goal: Deployment of the system increases the number of items recycled, and decreases the incidence of non-recyclable objects being mixed with recyclable items in the recycling bin due to misinformation about what items can and cannot be recycled.
> - Tertiary Goal: Educate the general public on what items can be recycled and which ones cannot.

## Reflections
The project presents an innovative system designed to recognize recyclable objects, compost, batteries, and trash, aiming to contribute to environmental conservation, waste reduction, and consumer education while offering convenience. Targeting general public spaces like airports, cafeterias, malls, and stadiums, it caters to busy individuals who might lack the knowledge or time to sort their trash effectively. Utilizing teachable machine technology and integrating multiple sensors, such as qwiic connectors, servo motors, LED strips, buttons, and OLED screens, the system provides real-time feedback. It notifies users when the trash is full, needs emptying, and can even suggest replacements for discarded items via platforms like Amazon or Instacart. Additionally, the system displays the total quantity of each recycled or disposed material, enhancing user awareness and participation in recycling efforts. An essential feature is its capability for failure correction and improvement, where users can notify the system if an item is misclassified. This prompts the trashcan to capture a picture of the object, enabling better future classification and continuous learning. 

Through the experience, we learned lots about multiple sensor integration and how to deal with errors when many sensors are connected in order. We also went through many design considerations when we ideated, prototyped, laser cut, and built it but we chose this layout for ease of access and modularity. 

## Future Improvements

We hope to send text notifications to building cleaning facilities to notify them when the bin is full. For single-family homes, we could add features where you have a copy of that item added to your Amazon shopping cart when you trash the original one. We would also want to improve the design of the camera scanning area and find ways to prevent lighting issues from preventing correct classification. 

## Teams
**William Reid (wjr83):** Purchased the sensors, and trash bins, laser-cut & designed the scanning areas for the iRecycle scanning area, laser-cut & designed lids for each bin, laser-cut & designed battery bin, programmed the servo lifting, button misclassification handling, designed layout for iPad screen to show statistics on how much has been trashed and what the current label is of the item being trashed. 

**Khushi Bhansali (kb737):** Programmed distance sensors to recognize when bin is full. Helped assemble the servo motors to the bins, and helped design the positioning of the bin and sensor locations. Videotaped the final working version. Completed the documentation.
