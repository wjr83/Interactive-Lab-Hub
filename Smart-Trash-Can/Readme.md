## Project Plan
Using the tools and techniques learned in this class, design, prototype, and test an interactive device that can distinguish between recyclable objects (paper, cardboard, plastic, glass, metal), trash, and batteries. 

#### COLLABORATOR: [Khushi Bhansali (ID: kb737)](https://github.com/Khushibhansali/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Fall2023/FinalProject.md)

### Big Idea & Motivation for Project & Objective
- A system to recognize recyclable objects from non-recyclable objects is motivated by several factors:

> - Environmental Conservation: Effective waste separation and recycling play a crucial role in reducing the environmental impact of waste disposal. It helps conserve resources, reduce energy consumption, and lower greenhouse gas emissions.
> - Waste Reduction: Proper recycling minimizes the volume of waste sent to landfills or incinerators, leading to a reduction in the need for landfill space and decreased pollution from incineration.
> - Consumer Education: Confusion among individuals about the correct sorting of waste is a common issue. This system can serve as an educational tool, clarifying recycling guidelines and encouraging responsible disposal practices.
> - Convenience: Many consumers find it challenging to decipher complex instructions or symbols on bins. A machine learning solution simplifies the process by instantly classifying waste items through images, making it more user-friendly.

#### Intended Operation
- The system identifies an object and classifies it as one of the 5 recycled materials (paper, cardboard, glass, plastic, and metal), compost, special handling materials (e.g., batteries), or otherwise as trash.

> - Primary Goal: Design a system capable of identifying recyclable objects (paper, cardboard, plastic, glass, and metal), compost, items requiring special handling (e.g., batteries), and trash.
> - Secondary Goal: Deployment of the system increases the number of items recycled, and decreases the incidence of non-recyclable objects being mixed with recyclable items in the recycling bin due to misinformation about what items can and cannot be recycled.
> - Tertiary Goal: Educate the general public on what items can be recycled and which ones cannot.

## Teams
**William Reid (wjr83):** Purchased the sensors, trash bins, lasor cut & designed the scanning areas for the iRecycle scanning area, lasor cut & designed lids for each bin, lasor cut & designed battery bin, programmed the servo lifting, button misclassification handling, designed layout for iPad screen to show statistics on how much has been trashed and what the current label is of the item being trashed. 

**Khushi Bhansali (kb737):** Programmed distance sensors to recognize when bin is full. Helped assemble the servo motors to the bins, helped design the positioning of the bin and sensor locations. Video taped the final working version. Completed the documentation.
