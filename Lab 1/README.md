# Staging Interaction

\*\***Collaborators: Khushi Bhansali, NetID kb737 ([GitHub Page](https://github.com/Khushibhansali/Interactive-Lab-Hub))**\*\*

In the original stage production of Peter Pan, Tinker Bell was represented by a darting light created by a small handheld mirror off-stage, reflecting a little circle of light from a powerful lamp. Tinkerbell communicates her presence through this light to the other characters. See more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_Bell). 

There is no actor that plays Tinkerbell--her existence in the play comes from the interactions that the other characters have with her.

For lab this week, we draw on this and other inspirations from theatre-to-stage interactions with a device where the main mode of display/output for the interactive device you are designing is lighting. You will plot the interaction with a storyboard, and use your computer and a smartphone to experiment with what the interactions will look and feel like. 

_Make sure you read all the instructions and understand the whole of the laboratory activity before starting!_



## Prep

### To start the semester, you will need:
1. Read about Git [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F).
2. Set up your own Github "Lab Hub" repository to keep all you work in record by [following these instructions](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2021Fall/readings/Submitting%20Labs.md).
3. Set up the README.md for your Hub repository (for instance, so that it has your name and points to your own Lab 1) and [learn how to](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) organize and post links to your submissions on your README.md so we can find them easily.


### For this lab, you will need:
1. Paper
2. Markers/ Pens
3. Scissors
4. Smart Phone -- The main required feature is that the phone needs to have a browser and display a webpage.
5. Computer -- We will use your computer to host a webpage which also features controls.
6. Found objects and materials -- You will have to costume your phone so that it looks like some other devices. These materials can include doll clothes, a paper lantern, a bottle, human clothes, a pillow case, etc. Be creative!

### Deliverables for this lab are: 
1. 7 Storyboards
1. 3 Sketches/photos of costumed devices
1. Any reflections you have on the process
1. Video sketch of 3 prototyped interactions
1. Submit the items above in the lab1 folder of your class [Github page], either as links or uploaded files. Each group member should post their own copy of the work to their own Lab Hub, even if some of the work is the same from each person in the group.

### The Report
This README.md page in your own repository should be edited to include the work you have done (the deliverables mentioned above). Following the format below, you can delete everything but the headers and the sections between the **stars**. Write the answers to the questions under the starred sentences.

## Part A. Plan 

\*\***Describe your setting, players, activity, and goals here.**\*\*

**Scenario:** Sound waves are everywhere. And everywhere, sound waves are intensifying. Noise pollution adversely affects the health of millions of people every day. Studies in humans have shown that in addition to hearing loss, exposure to loud noise can cause high blood pressure, heart disease, sleep disturbances, and stress. Increasing noise pollution also negatively impacts the health and well-being of wildlife, both on land and at sea. Many animals use sound to navigate, attract mates, and find food. These are all vital tasks that determine an animal's ability to survive. In other words, noise disruptances can affect the survival of entire populations of species.

**Motivation for Interactive Device:** In hopes of mitigating the adverse effects of noise pollution on the human population, the interactive device described below will alert the end user if exposed to unhealthy noise levels. 

**_Setting:_** The interaction is happening throughout every activity the end user performs. It is happening at the 6:00 AM yoga class, at the park, while driving to work, in the evening when mowing the lawn, walking through the streets during rush hours, in autumn preparing for winter (gathering wood for the chimney), at night while attending a rock concert, etc. 

**_Players:_** An individual who wants to protect his/her ears and those of the people near him/her. 

**_Activity:_** The individual goes about his day carrying or wearing his interactive device. Meanwhile, the interactive device samples ambient noise every 5 seconds and informs the user via a color display the degree of noise pollution he/she is exposed to. 

**_Goals:_** Reduce one's exposure to noise pollution in order to enhance well-being.

Storyboards are a tool for visually exploring a user's interaction with a device. They are a fast and cheap method to understand user flow and iterate on a design before attempting to build on it. Take some time to read through this explanation of [storyboarding in UX design](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/10/storyboarding-ux-design/). Sketches of seven storyboards of the interaction planned are shown below. 

\*\***Include pictures of your storyboards here**\*\*

**Legend:** Noise level in decibels (dB) color-coded.

Present your ideas to the other people in your breakout room (or in small groups). You can just get feedback from one another or you can work together on the other parts of the lab.

\*\***Summarize feedback you got here.**\*\*
  1. What if the end-user is color-blind? How might he/she be informed of the degree of the noise pollution (minimal to severe) without being confused by the colors?
  2. What if the end-user is blind? 

## Part B. Act out the Interaction

\*\***Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**\*\*
- I originally thought I would be more attentive to the changes in color while doing regular activities throughout the day. However, that was not the case. As someone who tries to minimize screentime as much as possible, I would dislike having to constantly glance at the interactive device to verify whether the noise pollution I am exposed to exceeds the recommended upper limit. Though auditive alerts are not appropriate for this application, some type of alert should call the user's attention if the noise levels are close to reaching those that could cause hearing damage. The device should make greater and greater efforts to alert the user if the noise level continues to intensify past the safe limits.

\*\***Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**\*\*
- If the user is not looking at the interactive device, should he/she be alerted via vibration of an unhealthy increase in noise level?
- What if in addition to only alerting the user of exposure to noise pollution, the interactive device could also help mitigate the adverse consequences of noise pollution by dampening the noise pollution if the decibels measured exceed a certain threshold. For example, the Centers for Disease Control advises that prolonged exposure to noise above 70 dB starts to deteriorate one's hearing sensitivity. Additionally, noises above 120 dB result in immediate harm to the ears.
> - Therefore, to reduce or eliminate harmful noise levels, the interactive device could generate anti-noise sounds to cancel or reduce the perceived noises of the environment.

- An air pollution sensor could be designed in a similar way as the noise pollution sensor described. Refer to the rough storyboard below of the air pollution interaction. **NOTE:** For the purposes of this lab, we will focus on the noise pollution interactive device.

## Part C. Prototype the device

You will be using your smartphone as a stand-in for the device you are prototyping. You will use the browser of your smartphone to act as a “light” and use a remote control interface to remotely change the light on that device. 

Code for the "Tinkerbelle" tool, and instructions for setting up the server and your phone are [here](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/tinkerbelle).

We invented this tool for this lab! 

If you run into technical issues with this tool, you can also use a light switch, dimmer, etc. that you can manually or remotely control.

\*\***Give us feedback on Tinkerbelle.**\*\*
- After several hours of troubleshooting Tinkerbelle on my Ubuntu 22.04 system, though I could run ```tinker.py``` successfully, I could not connect to the ```localhost``` on my Ubuntu system nor on my iPhone, which were both connected to the same WiFi. I made sure to turn off all firewalls and VPNs on both devices. I also created a new virtual environment specifically for running Tinkerbelle. Unfortunately, that didn't make a difference on my Ubuntu system. I decided to switch over to my Windows 10 partition and run it from there. Tinkerbelle ran successfully on the first try, including connecting to ```localhost:5001```. 
> - It would be appreciated if Tinkerbelle could be made compatible with Linux distributions, such as Ubuntu 22.04.

## Part D. Wizard the device
\*\***Include your first attempts at recording the set-up video here.**\*\*

## Part E. Costume the device

\*\***Include sketches of what your devices might look like here.**\*\*
Costume #1 & #2:
![image](https://github.com/wjr83/Interactive-Lab-Hub/assets/143034234/2d3b5775-eb0f-480a-8dc2-8931a5e51ebd)

Costume #3: Student ID or Work ID will flash a decibel color according to the ambient noise loudness measured.
![image_6487327](https://github.com/wjr83/Interactive-Lab-Hub/assets/143034234/0d0a3cc9-68a5-4f74-9540-009e941d8295)

**NOTE:** Water can damage all three of these costumes/devices if the noise pollution feature is turned on at the moment of water ingress.

\*\***What concerns or opportunities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?**\*\*
- Hospital systems have programs where physicians exposed to radiation are required to wear dosimeters to help record total radiation over time. Dosimeters are devices that measure and record the amount of radiation a person receives. They are required by state and federal regulations if someone is likely to receive more than 10% of the maximum permissible dose. Dosimeters in the hospital setting usually look like badges and these pass by unnoticed by most who are unaware of this technology.
> - Costume #3 shown above was inspired by thinking exclusively about dosimeters used by interventional radiologists. It was also my intention to incorporate the decibel sensor into everyday objects, such that the end-user will carry this interactive noise sensor device at all times without having to remember to grab it. Objects that we usually carry on our daily routines are:
> > - A watch (costume #1)
> > - Keys (this inspired the keychain of costume #2)
> > - A student ID or work badge (costume #3)

## Part F. Record

\*\***Take a video of your prototyped interaction.**\*\*

# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

## Part A. Plan 
\*\***Include pictures of your storyboards here**\*\*

**Storyboard #1:  This is the storyboard we decided to pursue for this part.**
 - **_Setting_**: Grocery store or supermarket anytime from 9-5pm.
 - **_Players_**: People who are shopping, kids, supermarket workers, and people surrounding the shoppers whose opinions could be influenced as a result of the "Nutriscore Companion". 
 - **_Activity_**: An individual wears the "Nutriscore Companion" device on their wrist. They can scan an item they are interested in purchasing. "Nutriscore Companion" will tell them how safe/healthy/chemical-free the item is. "Nutriscore Companion" will give the user a ranking of A being the healthiest to E being the unhealthiest. In the example storyboard, when the user scanned the bottle of deodorant, a list of ingredients revealed talcum powder which typically has traces of asbestos and was therefore given a ranking of E, and a red screen was displayed on the "Nutriscore Companion" device. 
 - **_Goals_**: To help shoppers purchase items that are safe, healthy, and chemical-free. Users are rewarded with a vibration from the device indicating that they should add it to the cart and redeemable points towards an item of their choice.

**Storyboard #2:**
 - **_Setting_:** Artist's room. 
 - **_Players_:** Single-player of just an artist.
 - **_Activity_:** If an artist is stuck on what to paint, they can open the "Random Paint Generator" device. This device will generate 5 random colors for the artist to paint with.
 - **_Goals_:** To help artist decide what colors to paint with and showcase their work in a digital museum. This offers the artist greater incentive and exposure. 

<img src="https://github.com/Khushibhansali/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Fall2023/Lab%201/storyboards/paint.jpg" width="650" height="350" alt="image">

**Storyboard #3:**
 - **_Setting_:** The game is set in shared living spaces like homes or communal areas with a virtual overlay light of the streets.   
 - **_Players_:** The primary user engages directly with the game, while passive observers, like friends and family, may watch or provide input. Roommates may be impacted by the game's lights and sounds.    Children and pets could be curious or influenced by game elements, and neighbors may notice noise or light effects. 
 - **_Activity_:** When the light is green, players run. When it's yellow, they slow down to a walk, and when it turns red, they stop. The objective is to follow these signals correctly. The player who fails to follow the signal gets eliminated from the game, while the reward for the last remaining player is to be freed from the game, signifying their victory.
 - **_Goals_:** The goal of each player in the traffic light game is to accurately follow the traffic signals, avoid elimination, and ultimately be the last remaining player to win and exit the game. 

<img src="https://github.com/Khushibhansali/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Fall2023/Lab%201/storyboards/trafficlightgame.jpg" width="650" height="350" alt="image">

**Storyboard #4:**  
 - **_Setting_:** An AR/VR environment of a zoo with digital animals like dolphins, monkeys, parrots, and giraffes.
 - **_Players_:** Anyone with an AR/VR headset who is exploring the virtual zoo. Additionally, the people in the physical environment surrounding the AR/VR player may also become secondary players as they observe and potentially interact with the AR/VR experience.  
 - **_Activity_:** The interaction between the actors involves players commanding digital animals to perform tricks using a light signal. Players illuminate the digital animal with a specific light, and the animal responds by executing a trick corresponding to the color of the light. This interaction allows players to engage with the digital animals without the need for a zookeeper, creating an entertaining and interactive experience.
 - **_Goals_:** Players can elicit a happy dance from the digital animal, create a colorful screen display, and enable the animal to perform tricks independently, all through the effective use of light signals.

**Storyboard #5:** 
 - **_Setting_:** A remote and lush jungle devoid of cellular reception or police presence, but equipped with a device containing survival essentials like instructions, food, clothing, and basic necessities.
 - **_Players_:** A team comprising coworkers from an office.
 - **_Activity_:** Stranded in the jungle, players receive instructions from the device to undertake a scavenger hunt as their means of escaping. Their task is to match the colors displayed on the device with elements in the natural surroundings. Completing all color matches enables their escape.
 - **_Goals_:** Foster team bonding among coworkers and successfully leave the jungle by completing the scavenger hunt challenge.

<img src="https://github.com/Khushibhansali/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Fall2023/Lab%201/storyboards/survivor.jpg" width="650" height="350" alt="image">

**Storyboard #6:**  
 - **_Setting_:** The kitchen.
 - **_Players_:** A novice cook.
 - **_Activity_:** An intelligent pot equipped with LED lights on the handle indicates the pot's temperature. The user can program the pot to cook foods at their desired temperature. When the food is cooked, the pot turns off and plays a song as a delightful reward. The strategically placed LED lights on the handle ensure they are not damaged by flames, as it's an electric pot with temperature control. Additionally, it's waterproof, allowing easy cleaning.
 - **_Goals_:** Enhance users' ability to multitask, make cooking an enjoyable experience, and provide a musical reward when the food is ready.

## Part B. Act out the Interaction

Try physically acting out the interaction you planned. For now, you can just pretend the device is doing the things you’ve scripted for it. 

\*\***Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**\*\*

The concept of the "Nutriscore Companion" device, designed to empower consumers to make healthier choices while shopping, introduces a complex array of considerations. There are concerns about its impact on the shopping experience as users scan items for information, which could potentially slow down the process and lead to frustration, particularly during busy hours. Accuracy and ethical criteria for rankings are paramount, as misleading information could harm consumers and manufacturers, prompting ethical concerns if rankings lack scientific rigor. Privacy and data security issues arise from collecting user shopping data, requiring ethical safeguards and informed consent. The device's guidance may oversimplify decisions, potentially compromising users' independent choices. Ethical communication practices are crucial to prevent undue panic when the device displays unfavorable product ratings. Sustainability is also essential, encompassing device production, use, and disposal. In sum, successful deployment of such a device necessitates careful attention to ethical design, user education, and seamless integration into the shopping experience to balance benefits with potential drawbacks.

\*\***Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**\*\*

We've explored the potential for incorporating augmented reality (AR) to provide users with immersive product information when they scan items, enhancing their understanding of nutritional value and environmental impact. Additionally, integrating machine learning algorithms to personalize recommendations based on individual dietary preferences and restrictions has been a focus. To address privacy concerns, advanced encryption techniques, and decentralized data storage have been considered to ensure data security. Furthermore, to enhance sustainability, we've explored using eco-friendly materials for the device and incorporating a recycling program for its components.

## Part C. Prototype the device
You will be using your smartphone as a stand-in for the device you are prototyping. You will use the browser of your smartphone to act as a “light” and use a remote control interface to remotely change the light on that device. 

Code for the "Tinkerbelle" tool, and instructions for setting up the server and your phone are [here](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/tinkerbelle).

We invented this tool for this lab! 

If you run into technical issues with this tool, you can also use a light switch, dimmer, etc. that you can manually or remotely control.
## Part D. Wizard the device
Take a little time to set up the wizarding set-up that allows for someone to remotely control the device while someone acts with it. Hint: You can use Zoom to record videos, and you can pin someone’s video feed if that is the scene that you want to record. 

\*\***Include your first attempts at recording the set-up video here.**\*\*
For these videos, we were trying to be mindful of different types of users. We added an audio component so color-blind users are taken into account.

## Part E. Costume the device

Transforming the "Nutriscore Companion" into a watch introduces critical design considerations that were taken into consideration in the following designs. Given its potential use in various environments, it's crucial to prevent overheating by implementing effective heat dissipation measures. Waterproofing is equally essential, considering the watch's exposure to rain and water splashes during daily activities. In an emergency, visibility is key, and while bright colors can aid visibility, it's imperative to balance aesthetics and practicality to ensure the display remains user-friendly and legible in low-light or critical situations.

**Please indicate anyone you collaborated with on this Lab.**
I worked with my partner Khushi Bhansali. We were inspired by Europe's existing [NutriScore implementation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutri-Score) as labels on food packaging. However, throughout this project, we got to take it to the next level as a live interactive experience for all supermarket products, not just food products!
