\*\***Collaborators: Khushi Bhansali, NetID kb737 ([GitHub Page](https://github.com/Khushibhansali/Interactive-Lab-Hub))**\*\*

## Part A. Plan 

**Scenario:** Sound waves are everywhere. And everywhere, sound waves are intensifying. Noise pollution adversely affects the health of millions of people every day. Studies in humans have shown that in addition to hearing loss, exposure to loud noise can cause high blood pressure, heart disease, sleep disturbances, and stress. Increasing noise pollution also negatively impacts the health and well-being of wildlife, both on land and at sea. Many animals use sound to navigate, attract mates, and find food. These are all vital tasks that determine an animal's ability to survive. In other words, noise disruptances can affect the survival of entire populations of species.

**Motivation for Interactive Device:** In hopes of mitigating the adverse effects of noise pollution on the human population, the interactive device described below will alert the end user if exposed to unhealthy noise levels. 

**_Setting:_** The interaction is happening throughout every activity the end user performs. It is happening at the 6:00 AM yoga class, at the park, while driving to work, in the evening when mowing the lawn, walking through the streets during rush hours, in autumn preparing for winter (gathering wood for the chimney), at night while attending a rock concert, etc. 

**_Players:_** An individual who wants to protect his/her ears and those of the people near him/her. 

**_Activity:_** The individual goes about his day carrying or wearing his interactive device. Meanwhile, the interactive device samples ambient noise every 5 seconds and informs the user via a color display the degree of noise pollution he/she is exposed to. 

**_Goals:_** Reduce one's exposure to noise pollution in order to enhance well-being.

Sketches of seven storyboards of the interaction planned are shown below. 

**Legend:** Noise level in decibels (dB) color-coded.

\*\***Feedback Received:**\*\*
  1. What if the end-user is color-blind? How might he/she be informed of the degree of the noise pollution (minimal to severe) without being confused by the colors?
  2. What if the end-user is blind? 

## Part B. Act out the Interaction

\*\***Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**\*\*
- I originally thought I would be more attentive to the changes in color while doing regular activities throughout the day. However, that was not the case. As someone who tries to minimize screentime as much as possible, I would dislike having to constantly glance at the interactive device to verify whether the noise pollution I am exposed to exceeds the recommended upper limit. Though auditive alerts are not appropriate for this application, some type of alert should call the user's attention if the noise levels are close to reaching those that could cause hearing damage. The device should make greater and greater efforts to alert the user if the noise level continues to intensify past the safe limits.

\*\***Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**\*\*
- If the user is not looking at the interactive device, should he/she be alerted via vibration of an unhealthy increase in noise level?
- What if in addition to only alerting the user of exposure to noise pollution, the interactive device could also help mitigate the adverse consequences of noise pollution by dampening the noise pollution if the decibels measured exceed a certain threshold. For example, the Centers for Disease Control advises that prolonged exposure to noise above 70 dB starts to deteriorate one's hearing sensitivity. Additionally, noises above 120 dB result in immediate harm to the ears.
> - Therefore, to reduce or eliminate harmful noise levels, the interactive device could generate anti-noise sounds to cancel or reduce the perceived noises of the environment.

- An air pollution sensor could be designed in a similar way as the noise pollution sensor described. Refer to the rough storyboard below of the air pollution interaction. **NOTE:** For the purposes of this lab, we will focus on the noise pollution interactive device.

## Part C. Prototype the device

\*\***Feedback on Tinkerbelle:**\*\*
- After several hours of troubleshooting Tinkerbelle on my Ubuntu 22.04 system, though I could run ```tinker.py``` successfully, I could not connect to the ```localhost``` on my Ubuntu system nor on my iPhone, which were both connected to the same WiFi. I made sure to turn off all firewalls and VPNs on both devices. I also created a new virtual environment specifically for running Tinkerbelle. Unfortunately, that didn't make a difference on my Ubuntu system. I decided to switch over to my Windows 10 partition and run it from there. Tinkerbelle ran successfully on the first try, including connecting to ```localhost:5001```. 
> - It would be appreciated if Tinkerbelle could be made compatible with Linux distributions, such as Ubuntu 22.04.

## Part E. Costume the device

\*\***Sketches of what the devices might look like:**\*\*
Costume #1 & #2:

Costume #3: Student ID or Work ID will flash a decibel color according to the ambient noise loudness measured.
![image_6487327](https://github.com/wjr83/Interactive-Lab-Hub/assets/143034234/0d0a3cc9-68a5-4f74-9540-009e941d8295)

**NOTE:** Water can damage all three of these costumes/devices if the noise pollution feature is turned on at the moment of water ingress.

\*\***What concerns or opportunities are influencing the way we've designed the device to look?**\*\*
- Hospital systems have programs where physicians exposed to radiation are required to wear dosimeters to help record total radiation over time. Dosimeters are devices that measure and record the amount of radiation a person receives. They are required by state and federal regulations if someone is likely to receive more than 10% of the maximum permissible dose. Dosimeters in the hospital setting usually look like badges and these pass by unnoticed by most who are unaware of this technology.
> - Costume #3 shown above was inspired by thinking exclusively about dosimeters used by interventional radiologists. It was also my intention to incorporate the decibel sensor into everyday objects, such that the end-user will carry this interactive noise sensor device at all times without having to remember to grab it. Objects that we usually carry on our daily routines are:
> > - A watch (costume #1)
> > - Keys (this inspired the keychain of costume #2)
> > - A student ID or work badge (costume #3)

# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

## Part A. Plan 

**Storyboard #1:  This is the storyboard we decided to pursue for this part.**
 - **_Setting_**: Grocery store or supermarket anytime from 9-5pm.
 - **_Players_**: People who are shopping, kids, supermarket workers, and people surrounding the shoppers whose opinions could be influenced as a result of the "Nutriscore Companion". 
 - **_Activity_**: An individual wears the "Nutriscore Companion" device on their wrist. They can scan an item they are interested in purchasing. "Nutriscore Companion" will tell them how safe/healthy/chemical-free the item is. "Nutriscore Companion" will give the user a ranking of A being the healthiest to E being the unhealthiest. In the example storyboard, when the user scanned the bottle of deodorant, a list of ingredients revealed talcum powder which typically has traces of asbestos and was therefore given a ranking of E, and a red screen was displayed on the "Nutriscore Companion" device. 
 - **_Goals_**: To help shoppers purchase items that are safe, healthy, and chemical-free. Users are rewarded with a vibration from the device indicating that they should add it to the cart and redeemable points towards an item of their choice.

**Storyboard #2:**
 - **_Setting_:** Artist's room. 
 - **_Players_:** Single-player of just an artist.
 - **_Activity_:** If an artist is stuck on what to paint, they can open the "Random Paint Generator" device. This device will generate 5 random colors for the artist to paint with.
 - **_Goals_:** To help artist decide what colors to paint with and showcase their work in a digital museum. This offers the artist greater incentive and exposure.

**Storyboard #3:**
 - **_Setting_:** The game is set in shared living spaces like homes or communal areas with a virtual overlay light of the streets.   
 - **_Players_:** The primary user engages directly with the game, while passive observers, like friends and family, may watch or provide input. Roommates may be impacted by the game's lights and sounds.    Children and pets could be curious or influenced by game elements, and neighbors may notice noise or light effects. 
 - **_Activity_:** When the light is green, players run. When it's yellow, they slow down to a walk, and when it turns red, they stop. The objective is to follow these signals correctly. The player who fails to follow the signal gets eliminated from the game, while the reward for the last remaining player is to be freed from the game, signifying their victory.
 - **_Goals_:** The goal of each player in the traffic light game is to accurately follow the traffic signals, avoid elimination, and ultimately be the last remaining player to win and exit the game.

**Storyboard #4:**  
 - **_Setting_:** An AR/VR environment of a zoo with digital animals like dolphins, monkeys, parrots, and giraffes.
 - **_Players_:** Anyone with an AR/VR headset who is exploring the virtual zoo. Additionally, the people in the physical environment surrounding the AR/VR player may also become secondary players as they observe and potentially interact with the AR/VR experience.  
 - **_Activity_:** The interaction between the actors involves players commanding digital animals to perform tricks using a light signal. Players illuminate the digital animal with a specific light, and the animal responds by executing a trick corresponding to the color of the light. This interaction allows players to engage with the digital animals without the need for a zookeeper, creating an entertaining and interactive experience.
 - **_Goals_:** Players can elicit a happy dance from the digital animal, create a colorful screen display, and enable the animal to perform tricks independently, all through the effective use of light signals.

## Part B. Act out the Interaction

\*\***Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**\*\*

The concept of the "Nutriscore Companion" device, designed to empower consumers to make healthier choices while shopping, introduces a complex array of considerations. There are concerns about its impact on the shopping experience as users scan items for information, which could potentially slow down the process and lead to frustration, particularly during busy hours. Accuracy and ethical criteria for rankings are paramount, as misleading information could harm consumers and manufacturers, prompting ethical concerns if rankings lack scientific rigor. Privacy and data security issues arise from collecting user shopping data, requiring ethical safeguards and informed consent. The device's guidance may oversimplify decisions, potentially compromising users' independent choices. Ethical communication practices are crucial to prevent undue panic when the device displays unfavorable product ratings. Sustainability is also essential, encompassing device production, use, and disposal. In sum, successful deployment of such a device necessitates careful attention to ethical design, user education, and seamless integration into the shopping experience to balance benefits with potential drawbacks.

\*\***Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**\*\*

We've explored the potential for incorporating augmented reality (AR) to provide users with immersive product information when they scan items, enhancing their understanding of nutritional value and environmental impact. Additionally, integrating machine learning algorithms to personalize recommendations based on individual dietary preferences and restrictions has been a focus. To address privacy concerns, advanced encryption techniques, and decentralized data storage have been considered to ensure data security. Furthermore, to enhance sustainability, we've explored using eco-friendly materials for the device and incorporating a recycling program for its components.

## Part C & D: Prototype the device & Wizard the device

For these videos, we were trying to be mindful of different types of users. We added an audio component so color-blind users are taken into account.

## Part E. Costume the device

Transforming the "Nutriscore Companion" into a watch introduces critical design considerations that were taken into consideration in the following designs. Given its potential use in various environments, it's crucial to prevent overheating by implementing effective heat dissipation measures. Waterproofing is equally essential, considering the watch's exposure to rain and water splashes during daily activities. In an emergency, visibility is key, and while bright colors can aid visibility, it's imperative to balance aesthetics and practicality to ensure the display remains user-friendly and legible in low-light or critical situations.

**Please indicate anyone you collaborated with on this Lab.**
I worked with my partner Khushi Bhansali. We were inspired by Europe's existing [NutriScore implementation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutri-Score) as labels on food packaging. However, throughout this project, we got to take it to the next level as a live interactive experience for all supermarket products, not just food products!
